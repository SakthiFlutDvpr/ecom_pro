  String titleOne = "Why are Organic products expensive than normal?";
  String paraOne =
      "Currently Organic products are grown by only a small section of the farming community, due to various factors like yield is less and it usually it takes 3-4 years time to prepare the soil for Organic production. The limited supply of these products leads to higher costs. But as awareness about the health benefits of organic produce increase, more farmers will come forward to produce them, ultimately leading to a reduction in prices. In short, since yield per acre of land is less, production is less, as a result costs are high. Over the years, the price of Organic should match the market expectations where the consumer and the farmer benefit";
